# Computational model of the environment of an autonomous vehicle
This is repo about my diploma thesis. Thesis is in CZ.

The aim of this thesis is to develop a functional computational model for vehicle motion
prediction based on a search of sensors and their locations on the vehicle, neural networks
for computer vision, datasets for network learning, and programs for creating simulations
and virtual environments. The paper describes the process of creating the vehicle virtual
environment and simulation. In addition, sensor placement designs including their
parameters are developed. Subsequently, the programmed vehicle trajectory prediction
algorithm including learning and neural network implementation is presented. Finally,
the results of the developed algorithm are presented.
